// supervisor wire shape, and stays pure so the route's branching (materialized
// steps vs the honest graph.v2 degradation) is unit-testable without the DOM.

 * Why the step DAG is not shown. `graph_v2_root_only` is the known upstream
 * hole (the supervisor collapses graph.v2 run snapshots to the root bead, so
 * step nodes are not reconstructable — tracked by gascity-dashboard-jl3c);
 * `no_children` is a genuine leaf with nothing below it.
 *
 * The graph.v2 classification requires BOTH `gc.formula_contract=graph.v2` AND
 * a run-target key (`gc.run_target` OR the current `gc.routed_to`, which the
 * supervisor retired `gc.run_target` in favor of per gascity #2763) — the same
 * dual-key contract+target gate `rootRunTarget`/`resolveRunFormulaName` use
 * (formula-name.ts): only a fully-instantiated runnable root carries both.
 * A childless bead that has the contract label but no target (e.g. a stray
 * label on a non-run bead) is a genuine leaf, so it reports `no_children`
 * rather than the misleading "supervisor does not expose this run's step graph".
 *
 * Unlike the name fallback there, this gate intentionally does NOT also exclude
 * terminal-status roots: a completed graph.v2 run's steps are just as unexposed
 * as a running one's, so `graph_v2_root_only` stays the honest reason for it.
 * (The name fallback excludes terminal roots only to avoid trusting a retitled
 * closed root's title as a formula name — a different concern.)
