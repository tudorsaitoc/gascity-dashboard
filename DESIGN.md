# Design System: ds-research dashboard

## 1. Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Reading Room"**

A single-operator dashboard that reads like a thoughtfully-set page. The room is calm by default. The operator sits with it open for hours while she works on something else, glancing at it the way one glances at the spines of books on a shelf. When something is wrong, the page raises its voice the way a careful editor circles a word: with a single deliberate mark.

This system rejects the dense observability template (Datadog, Grafana, Splunk, Posthog) where every chart competes for attention and density pretends to be insight. It also rejects the dark-slate-and-neon look that every developer tool has converged on in 2026 (Linear, Vercel, Resend, the citadel default). The aesthetic lane is single-typeface editorial, in the Are.na / FT Edit / NYT Cooking-at-rest tradition. Bookish but not ornamental, confident but not loud.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Light by default. Dark optional for late-night use.
- One typeface family throughout, with weight and scale carrying the hierarchy.
- Surface is warm paper, body type is warm graphite, the single accent is maroon.
- No cards unless absolutely necessary. Sections are separated by rhythm and typography, not by containers.
- Numbers are typeset like the rest of the page: tabular figures, deliberate scale, aligned columns.

## 2. Colors

A warm restrained palette. Three roles, not five.

### Primary

- **Maroon Mark** (to be resolved during implementation; target: deep oxblood OKLCH around `oklch(38% 0.09 25)` in light theme, lifted to roughly `oklch(70% 0.10 25)` in dark theme): the only deliberate non-neutral. Used for the rare loud moment: an anomaly indicator, a focused state, a destructive action, a count that has crossed a threshold. The maroon never carries body type and never appears on more than ten percent of the visible page.

### Neutral

- **Warm Paper** (to be resolved; target: warm cream, very low chroma, very high lightness, tinted toward the maroon hue, e.g. `oklch(98% 0.008 25)`): the dominant surface. Reads as paper, not as white. Never `#fff`.
- **Warm Graphite** (to be resolved; target: warm near-black, low chroma, very low lightness, tinted toward the maroon hue, e.g. `oklch(20% 0.012 25)`): body type, headings, primary borders. Never `#000`.
- **Tea-Stain** (to be resolved; target: warm grey at roughly 45 percent lightness): secondary type, hairlines, divider rules.
- **Faint Margin** (to be resolved; target: warm grey at roughly 80 percent lightness): tertiary type, placeholder, disabled states.

### Status (always paired with a glyph and a word, never the primary signal)

- **Healthy Sage** (to be resolved; target: low-chroma green roughly 50 percent lightness): paired with an OK glyph and a word.
- **Caution Ochre** (to be resolved; target: warm amber roughly 60 percent lightness): paired with a warning glyph and a word.
- **Stuck Maroon**: same maroon as Primary, doubled-purpose for errored or stuck state. Always paired with the word.

### Named Rules

**The One Mark Rule.** The maroon appears at most once per visible viewport. If the page wants two maroons, one of them is wrong: either reread it as neutral or rethink the page.

**The Greyscale Test.** Strip every color from the page. The operator must still be able to read every state. Color is emphasis, not signal.

## 3. Typography

**Body Font:** A single warm-humanist sans across the entire system, weight range 400 to 700 (Söhne, Untitled Sans, Inter, IBM Plex Sans, or similar; final family chosen at implementation).

There is no display font. There is no serif accent. There is no monospace. The hierarchy comes entirely from size, weight, and tracking within one family. Tabular figures are required for any column of numbers.

**Character:** A single typeface read as a held note. The system's confidence comes from refusing to switch voice. When the operator reads the page, the type stays out of the way; when she reads a number, the figures line up; when she reads a heading, the size and weight do the work that cards and boxes do elsewhere.

### Hierarchy

- **Display** (weight 600, around 2.5rem, line-height 1.05, tracking -0.02em): view name at the top of a page. Used once per route.
- **Headline** (weight 600, around 1.5rem, line-height 1.15): section openers within a view. Two to four per route.
- **Title** (weight 500, around 1rem, line-height 1.35): subsection openers, row primary text in lists.
- **Body** (weight 400, around 0.9375rem, line-height 1.55, max 70ch): paragraphs of state, descriptions, prose. Tabular figures on.
- **Label** (weight 500, around 0.75rem, line-height 1.2, tracking 0.04em, all-caps): rare. Column headings and timestamp prefixes only.

### Named Rules

**The One Voice Rule.** One typeface family. No serif slip, no display font for headings, no mono for ids. If a designer reaches for a second family, they have stopped designing the system and started designing a spread.

**The Tabular Figures Rule.** Every column of numbers uses tabular figures. Body prose may use proportional figures. No exceptions in tables, counters, or timestamps.

## 4. Elevation

Flat by default. The page has no shadows, no ambient depth, no layered surfaces at rest. Hierarchy is carried by typography and whitespace.

Shadows appear only as response to state. A focused control gains a soft inset, a hovered list row gains a faint warm surface tint. No card receives a drop shadow simply because it is a card.

### Named Rules

**The Flat Page Rule.** A section is separated from another section by space and type, not by a container. Cards are forbidden as a structural default. They appear only when a contained item needs to be physically dragged, dismissed, or stacked.

## 5. Components

No components exist in this system yet. This file is a seed; re-run `/impeccable document` after the first pass of implementation lands real button, input, table, navigation, and list-row primitives. The Components section will be populated then with extracted tokens and HTML/CSS snippets.

In the meantime, every component built during initial implementation should satisfy:

- **Hierarchy by typography.** A heading is set, not boxed. A label is tracked, not tinted.
- **Whitespace as separator.** Rhythm between sections comes from space; container boundaries are a last resort.
- **One mark per region.** Maroon never appears twice in adjacent regions. If two regions both want emphasis, the page is unclear about what it is emphasising.
- **States have words.** Hover, focus, selected, disabled, errored. Every state has a textual or glyph correlate. Color is the accelerator, not the carrier.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- **Do** typeset numbers. Tabular figures on, aligned columns, deliberate scale. A counter is type, not a meter.
- **Do** carry hierarchy in size and weight. Headings get larger and heavier; subsection openers get smaller. The eye should know where it is from the shape of the type alone.
- **Do** use whitespace as a structural element. Two sections separated by space are clearer than two sections separated by a divider rule.
- **Do** keep the maroon rare. The accent earns its visibility from its scarcity.
- **Do** pair color with a glyph or a word for every status indicator. The page must remain readable in greyscale.
- **Do** respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. SSE-driven updates fade in over roughly 150ms. No slide, no bounce, no shimmer.

### Don't:

- **Don't** look like Posthog, Datadog, Grafana, or Splunk. Density is not insight. Brand-colored chart strips are not legibility.
- **Don't** look like Linear, Vercel, or Resend. Dark slate plus neon accent plus perfectly-rounded cards is the developer-tool reflex. We explicitly reject it.
- **Don't** use side-stripe borders. A colored left-edge on a list row or card is a side-stripe. Rewrite the element with whitespace, a leading glyph, or full hairline borders.
- **Don't** use gradient text or gradient buttons. Single solid color. Emphasis through weight and size.
- **Don't** use glassmorphism, backdrop blur, or translucent surfaces. The page is paper, not glass.
- **Don't** reach for a card. A card is an admission that the type was not doing its job.
- **Don't** introduce a second typeface family. One family, the whole way through. If something needs to look different, change its weight, scale, or tracking.
- **Don't** animate layout properties (height, top, width). State changes use opacity and transform only.
- **Don't** carry meaning in color alone. Strip the page to greyscale; every state must still be readable.
- **Don't** use em dashes in UI copy. Commas, colons, semicolons, periods, or parentheses.
- **Don't** use `#000` or `#fff`. Every neutral is tinted toward the maroon hue.
