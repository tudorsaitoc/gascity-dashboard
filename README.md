# gas-city-dashboard

An editorial-typographic ambient dashboard for a single [Gas City](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity) (`gc`) operator. Five views — Agents, Beads, Mail, Activity, Health — laid out as a thoughtfully-set page rather than a wall of cards. The room is calm by default; the only thing that earns the eye is something going wrong.

The shape is forked from [Wldc4rd/citadel](https://github.com/Wldc4rd/citadel) (MIT, Charlie Coutts) which solved the orchestrator-tab problem first. The visual register is a full redesign, driven through [impeccable](https://impeccable.style/) with the design context captured in [`PRODUCT.md`](PRODUCT.md) and [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).

## What it shows

- **Agents** — every session's state at a glance, with a Peek modal for `gc session peek` snapshots.
- **Beads** — engineering work in `gc bd` (system noise filtered by default), with inline claim / close / nudge and click-to-filter label chips.
- **Mail** — read any agent's inbox via a persistent "Reading as" strip. Sends always go from the operator; impersonation is read-only.
- **Activity** — recent commits and the dev-deploy log, with view tabs (recent · main / recent · all / 24h / 7d). Live updates via SSE from the supervisor.
- **Health** — supervisor state, host memory + load, admin process stats, plus a 24-hour dolt-noms trend sparkline.

## Quick start (dev)

```bash
git clone <your-clone-url> gas-city-dashboard
cd gas-city-dashboard
npm install
npm run build:shared            # types must build first

# Terminal 1 — backend on :8081
npm run dev:backend

# Terminal 2 — Vite dev server on :5174, proxies /api → :8081
npm run dev:frontend
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5174`. The dashboard expects a Gas City `gc supervisor` reachable on `http://127.0.0.1:8372` by default.

**Supported device surface.** Per [`PRODUCT.md`](PRODUCT.md), this dashboard targets a MacBook (typically via SSH port forward) and the host console. The layout stays stable from roughly 720px wide upward. Phone-size viewports are explicitly out of scope: there is no hamburger nav, no mobile drawer, no touch affordances. If the operator finds herself reaching for the phone, the answer is to open the laptop.

## Production build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node backend/dist/server.js     # serves API + frontend on :8081
```

For systemd-managed install: [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md).

## Configuration

All knobs are environment variables. See [`backend/src/config.ts`](backend/src/config.ts) for the authoritative list.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8081` | TCP port the dashboard listens on |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind interface. Set `0.0.0.0` for LAN access on a trusted network. |
| `ADMIN_EXTRA_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | (empty) | CSV of extra hostnames allowed in the `Host:` header (e.g. `my-vm,192.168.1.58`). The floor `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` is always allowed. |
| `GC_SUPERVISOR_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8372` | gc supervisor API base URL. |
| `GC_CITY_NAME` | `gas-city` | Name of the city this dashboard manages. One dashboard per city. |
| `ADMIN_AUDIT_LOG_PATH` | `$HOME/.gc/events.jsonl` | Where state-changing actions append audit entries. |
| `ADMIN_FRONTEND_DIST` | `../frontend/dist` | Path to built frontend assets. |
| `ADMIN_GIT_REPO` | `$HOME` | Repo for the Activity view's `git log` queries. |
| `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_DISABLED` | `0` | Kill switch. Set to `1` to refuse to start. |

For local dev a `.env.local` is convenient (not auto-loaded; source it explicitly):

```bash
set -a; . ./.env.local; set +a
npm run dev:backend
```

## Security model

Built for **single-operator** use on a **trusted network**.

- **Default bind** is `127.0.0.1` only — DNS-rebinding floor.
- **Host-header allow-list** always permits `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`; LAN names opt in via `ADMIN_EXTRA_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
- **CSRF** — state-changing endpoints require a token issued via cookie (double-submit pattern). The CSRF cookie is `gascity_admin_csrf`.
- **Origin check** — POST/PATCH/DELETE require an `Origin` matching the allowed-host set.
- **Content Security Policy** — `script-src 'self'`, no inline scripts, no `eval`.
- **Exec whitelist** — every shell-out is enumerated explicitly in [`backend/src/exec.ts`](backend/src/exec.ts). There is no general-purpose command execution path.

Full threat model: [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md).

## Stack

- **Backend** — Node 20 + Express + TypeScript. Single port serves API at `/api/*` and the SPA from `/`.
- **Frontend** — React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind, self-hosted Inter Variable. Single-page app, statically served by the backend in production.
- **Shared types** — `gas-city-dashboard-shared` workspace package. Wire-shape drift becomes a compile error on both sides.
- **Deploy** — systemd user unit. Deliberately *not* managed by `gc [[services]]`; see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for why the dashboard must outlive supervisor outages.

## Design context

This codebase carries two committed design artifacts at the root:

- [`PRODUCT.md`](PRODUCT.md) — Who the operator is, what she's doing when she looks at this, the brand personality (*"considered, literary, instrumental"*), and the strategic anti-references (Datadog density, Linear dark-slate, hero-metric cards).
- [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) — Creative North Star *"The Reading Room"*, the warm-paper + warm-graphite + maroon palette, the single-typeface Inter system, the `Flat Page Rule`, `One Mark Rule`, `One Voice Rule`, `Greyscale Test`, and the explicit Do's and Don'ts.

Subsequent design changes should be measured against these documents. Re-run `/impeccable document` after substantial visual changes to regenerate `DESIGN.md` from the actual implementation.
