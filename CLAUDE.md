# gas-city-dashboard — agent context

The durable conventions, invariants, and gotchas an agent must load to contribute here — the things the code does **not** announce about itself. Anything derivable from the source (file layout, component names, script flags, port numbers) is omitted on purpose: read the code, which is the canonical and non-stale record.

## What it is

An editorial-typographic ambient dashboard surfacing live state from a [Gas City](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity) (`gc`) supervisor over its HTTP API. npm workspaces: `backend` (Node + Express + TS), `frontend` (React + Vite + Tailwind), and `shared`.

- **`shared` is the single source of truth for wire-shape types.** Both sides import it, so a wire mismatch is a compile error, not a runtime `undefined`. Change a shape there, not ad hoc on either side.
- **The backend binds `127.0.0.1` only, by design.** For remote dev, forward the Vite port over SSH; never expose the backend.

## The contracts (they outrank assumed conventions)

- **`PRODUCT.md`** — what's being built and for whom. Strategic decisions defer to it.
- **`DESIGN.md`** — the binding visual contract; re-read it before any UI or UI-copy change. It defines the named rules and style absolutes and outranks habit. Don't restate it here — it would go stale against the source of truth.
- **`docs/{ARCHITECTURE,SECURITY,EXTENDING}.md`** — how things are wired, the security/impersonation model, and how to add a route or endpoint.

## Remote, CI, and the merge gate

Published at **github.com/sjarmak/gascity-dashboard**. Land feature work on branches and open PRs against `main`. (The git remote pointing at that URL is whatever your local clone named it — `git clone` defaults to `origin`, but a renamed remote is still fine; nothing in the workflow depends on the name.)

`main` is branch-protected — land work via a PR that passes CI (`.github/workflows`); you cannot push straight to `main`. **Match CI locally before pushing or the merge blocks:** the root `npm run typecheck` covers only each workspace's _app_ tsconfig, but CI also runs `typecheck:test` (backend + frontend), `frontend run build`, and both test suites. A change to a `shared` wire-shape type breaks `*.test.ts(x)` fixtures the app typecheck never sees — run both `typecheck:test`s too.

## Gotchas the code won't tell you

- **Tailwind config changes need a full Vite restart**, not HMR: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite && npm run dev:frontend`, or stale class definitions are served.
- **The Vite proxy's `changeOrigin: true` is load-bearing** — it makes write requests carry the backend's expected `Origin` and pass its allow-list. Don't remove it.
- **`.env.local` (gitignored) must be sourced** before the backend runs (it defines `GC_CITY_NAME`, `ADMIN_AUDIT_LOG_PATH`, etc.): `set -a; . ./.env.local; set +a`.
- **Formula run detail has a focused browser harness:** `node scripts/snap-formula-run-detail.mjs --test` clicks through `/runs` into a mocked run detail and fails on any broken `/api/*` call. It hardcodes `BASE=http://127.0.0.1:5174` and **does not start its own server** — it drives whatever vite is already serving there, so it tests the working tree of whichever checkout is running `npm run dev:frontend`. Running the harness from a worktree without retargeting the dev server just retests the primary tree. Playwright lives at `scripts/node_modules/` (per-script install), not at the root.

## Issue tracking

Work items live in **`bd` (beads)** in an embedded-dolt store at `.beads/`, isolated from the gc supervisor — these beads are **not** in the dashboard's own `/api/beads` view, and `.beads/` has no Dolt remote yet, so bead state is local-only. Anything that outlives the current task goes in `bd` (`bd ready` / `show` / `update --claim` / `close`), not scattered TODO comments.

## Architecture Best Practices

These apply to all code in this project — frontend and server:

- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** - write the tests first; the implementation
  code isn't done until the tests pass.
- **Consider First Principles** to assess your current architecture against the
  one you'd use if you started over from scratch.
- **Leverage Types** using statically typed languages (TypeScript, Rust, etc) so
  that we can leverage the power of the compiler as guardrails and immediate
  feedback on our code at build-time instead of waiting until run-time.
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** – eliminate duplicated logic by extracting
  shared utilities and modules.
- **Separation of Concerns** – each module should handle one distinct
  responsibility.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – every class/module/function/file
  should have exactly one reason to change.
- **Clear Abstractions & Contracts** – expose intent through small, stable
  interfaces and hide implementation details.
- **Low Coupling, High Cohesion** – keep modules self-contained, minimize
  cross-dependencies.
- **Scalability & Statelessness** – design components to scale horizontally and
  prefer stateless services when possible.
- **Observability & Testability** – build in logging, metrics, tracing, and
  ensure components can be unit/integration tested.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Sir)** - keep solutions as simple as possible.
- **YAGNI (You're Not Gonna Need It)** – avoid speculative complexity or
  over-engineering.
- **Don't Swallow Errors** by catching exceptions, silently filling in required
  but missing values, masking deserialization with nulls (or undefined values)
  or empty lists, or
  ignoring timeouts when something hangs. All of those are errors (client-side
  and server-side) and must be tracked in a centralized log so it can be used to
  improve the app over time. Also, inform the user as appropriate so that they
  can take necessary action.
- **No Placeholder Code** - we're building production code here, not toys.
- **No Comments for Removed Functionality** - the source is not the place to
  keep history of what's changed; it's the place to implement the current
  requirements only.
- **Layered Architecture** - organize code into clear tiers where each layer
  depends only on the one(s) below it, keeping logic cleanly separated.
- **Use Non-Nullable Variables** when possible; use nullability only when there
  is NO other possiblity.
- **Use Async Notifications** when possible over inefficient polling.
- **Eliminate Race Conditions** that might cause dropped or corrupted data
- **Write for Maintainability** so that the code is clear and readable and easy
  to maintain by future developers.
- **Arrange Project Idiomatically** for the language and framework being used,
  including recommended lints, static analysis tools, folder structure and
  gitignore entries.
- **Keep Serialization/Deserialization At The Edges** to make full use of
  type-safe objects in the app itself and to centralize error handling for
  type-system translation. Do NOT allow untyped data with known shapes to flow
  through the system and subvert the type system.
- **Prefer Well-Known, High Quality OSS Libraries** instead of hand-rolling your
  own behavior to get more robust, better maintained and better tested results.
- **Treat Static Warnings And Info As Errors To Be Fixed**. The whole point of
  static checking (linting, compilers, etc) is that they surface issues at
  build-time so that they can be fixed now instead of lead to errors at runtime.
  Take advantage of that feedback to fix those errors!
- **Use Centralized Semantic Constant Values** using enums and constants instead
  of spreading magic numbers through-out the code.
