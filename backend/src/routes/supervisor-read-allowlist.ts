//
// Only GET/HEAD requests whose path matches one of these templates are
// forwarded to the supervisor; every other path is rejected with 404. The list
// is deliberately the *minimal* set of supervisor reads the dashboard SPA
// performs — see the `getV0*` / SSE calls in `frontend/src/supervisor/*`. A new
// read view must be added here to work under read-only mode; until then it
// fails closed, which is the intended posture for an externally exposed
// instance.
//
// Side-effecting GETs are excluded on purpose. `agent/{base}/prime` (and its
// `{dir}/{base}` variant) is a state-changing GET flagged by the exposure
// premortem, so neither it nor the dynamic two-segment agent-detail reads are
// allowlisted — keeping the agent surface to the inert `agents` listing also
// avoids a `[^/]+`-collision where `agent/{base}/prime` would otherwise match a
// generic `agent/{dir}/{base}` pattern.
